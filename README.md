# Jest Another RPG-Object-Oriented-Programming

## Description

The purpose of this project was to learn about object-oriented-programming. Through the command line, a player starts the game and gives their name. They have starting stats provided, and then an enemy appears with a weapon and randomized stats. The player and enemy go back and forth attacking (or using a potion, in the player's case). If the player wins, they gain a potion and move on to the next enemy. If they lose, the game ends.
